# LD 48: "Deeper and Deeper"

## Running the release

Go to our ludumdare page, it has instructions and a link to play:
https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/inner-pieces

## Running from Source

Due to cross-origin rules, you will need to start a local webserver. I like to use, after `cd`ing into the source directory.

`python -m http.server`

but any local webserver will suffice. The above will host at `localhost:8000`. Simply open up `index.html`.
